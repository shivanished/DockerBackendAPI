# DockerBackendAPI

This is the Backend API for a personalized diet formulation website based on the Berkeley Dining Hall Menu. I made it for a consulting project with Docker where we showed it's capabilities in enabling a microservices architecture.

The API is hosted on Google Cloud Run; service URL: https://dietdroidbackend-qzkyxgkymq-wl.a.run.app
